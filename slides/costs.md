What are the costs and drawbacks:

* requires a meta-graph that points to which graph contains which non-blank resources
* the infrastructure behind the scenes is quite heavy
* SPARQL queries are auto-generated, thus may be not that optimal
* issues with multiple instance references of a blank node in multiple graphs
