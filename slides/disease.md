##The disease
Working with RDF data is not an easy task.

Either you've got to comply with the graph representation dropping all candies that the language you use gives (i.e. operators, inheritance, etc. in C#)...

... or you've got to switch to the language that has better support.

RDF graph is not an easy one itself and you've got to know i.e. SPARQL to query it. Yet another two more shortcuts to learn.
