Quick look at the ontology resulted in few data contracts that mapped all necessary types and relations into interfaces and properties.

With either:

* attribute - clean and readable
* fluent-like API mapping - gives more control and improves maintainability

whole process enables ordinary C# codes to read, write and query RDF data!
